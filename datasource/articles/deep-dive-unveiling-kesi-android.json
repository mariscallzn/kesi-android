We're jumping headfirst into the intricate world of Android development by dissecting a complete application: **Kesi Android**. Ever wondered what truly goes into building a robust, maintainable, and well-structured Android application? Beyond the UI and features, there's a hidden world of architectural decisions, best practices, and foundational setup that can make or break a project. This series is all about uncovering that world.",

Dependency injection is heavily utilized throughout the project, adhering to SOLID principles to create a more maintainable and testable codebase. A dedicated Gradle convention project plays a crucial role in coordinating dependencies and ensuring consistency across all modules; we'll dive deeper into the specifics of this Gradle convention plugin in a dedicated future post. For the presentation layer, the app primarily employs the Model-View-Intent (MVI) design pattern. We'll explore different flavors of its implementation, including a variation with a dedicated intent processor through a Factory to isolate UI logic and error handling for enhanced testability, as well as a more streamlined MVI approach with less specificity for simpler screens."

We'll delve into the \"why\" behind certain choices, discuss good practices that I've implemented (and perhaps some I've learned from!), and essentially lay bare all the guts of the project."
