/**
 * `AppRoute` is a marker interface used to identify classes that represent routes within the application.
 *
 * **Purpose:**
 * This interface serves as a type constraint, ensuring that only designated classes can be used as navigation destinations (routes).
 *
 * **Usage:**
 * Any class intended to represent a route within the application must implement this interface. This helps to clearly define and manage the application's navigation structure.
